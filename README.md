# Get Comfortable with .NET 5 and the CLI

**Level**: Introductory  

**Target**: C# developers who have been working with .NET Framework and are interested in moving to .NET 5. 

.NET 5 (formerly .NET Core) is the future of .NET. So let's get comfortable with the creating, running, and testing applications using the command-line interface. We'll create a self-hosted web service and then write an application to use that service. Unit tests will make sure things work along the way. Whether you're new to .NET 5 or have been using .NET 5 with Visual Studio, this session will help you get up-to-speed in this powerful environment.

## Demo
Be sure to take a look at the [**DemoWalkthrough.md**](https://github.com/jeremybytes/dotnet50-cli/blob/main/DemoWalkthrough.md) file. This walks through the process of starting with an empty folder and creating all of the projects in the repo.
